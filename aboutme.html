        <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello and Welcome! I'm a Undergraduate student at SRM University Computer Science Department.
            I am dedicated to my studies and always strive to improve my skills and knowledge.
            I have a strong foundation in C++ programming and have earned several certificates in core subjects.
            I have also applied my skills to develop projects that I am proud of.
            In my free time, I enjoy reading books, exploring new places, and capturing the beauty of the world through
            photography.
            My passion for technology drives me to excel in my field and make a positive impact.
